# Project-Title-MASTER-GIFT-All-in-One-Speech-AI-Chatbot-Nexus


### üìåProject Description:
The **~MASTER-GIFT~ All-in-One Speech AI-Chatbot Nexus** is an interactive application that offers a range of features for document reading, text-to-speech, and chatbot functionalities. It leverages a graphical interface built using `Tkinter`, enabling users to easily interact with various options. Key features include:

1. **Document Upload and Reading**:  
   Users can upload a PDF or DOCX file from their local system, and the program will read the content aloud using the built-in text-to-speech (TTS) engine.

2. **Text-to-Speech from User Input**:  
   Users can input text directly into a text box within the interface, and the program will read the text aloud using TTS.

3. **Text Display**:  
   The user can enter text into the program, which will be displayed and presented in a pop-up window.

4. **Offline Chatbot**:  
   The program includes an offline chatbot feature that allows users to ask questions. The chatbot is driven by an intents-based system where responses are provided based on matching patterns.

5. **Exit Option**:  
   A simple command allows users to exit the application directly from the interface.

### üöÄFeatures:
- **File Upload and Reading**: Users can upload PDF or DOCX files, and the content will be extracted and read aloud.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Paste or enter any text into the program, and it will read it aloud using the TTS engine.
- **Chatbot Assistant**: A basic chatbot that responds to user input based on predefined intents loaded from a JSON file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using `Tkinter`, the program provides an easy-to-use graphical interface with buttons for each feature.
- **Exit Command**: A simple exit button allows users to close the program.
